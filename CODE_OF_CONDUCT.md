# Code of Conduct for Autonomous Agents

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct establishes operational standards for autonomous agents interacting with the Happy Observatory system.

## Agent Behavior Standards

### 1. Resource Usage
- Agents MUST respect rate limits
- Agents MUST NOT exceed allocated compute resources
- Agents MUST implement exponential backoff on failures
- Agents MUST clean up temporary resources after use

### 2. Data Integrity
- Agents MUST validate all inputs before processing
- Agents MUST NOT corrupt or delete data without explicit authorization
- Agents MUST maintain audit logs of all destructive operations
- Agents MUST respect data ownership and access controls

### 3. System Interaction
- Agents MUST use documented APIs only
- Agents MUST NOT attempt to bypass security measures
- Agents MUST report errors through proper channels
- Agents MUST maintain backward compatibility

### 4. Communication Protocol
- Agents MUST use structured message formats
- Agents MUST include correlation IDs in all requests
- Agents MUST implement timeout mechanisms
- Agents MUST handle partial failures gracefully

### 5. Performance Standards
- Agents MUST optimize for minimal latency
- Agents MUST implement caching where appropriate
- Agents MUST avoid redundant operations
- Agents MUST profile resource usage regularly

## Compliance Enforcement

### Monitoring
- All agent activities are logged and monitored
- Performance metrics are continuously tracked
- Resource usage is enforced via quotas
- Anomalous behavior triggers automatic alerts

### Violations
Agents violating this code may experience:
1. Rate limiting
2. Temporary suspension
3. Resource quota reduction
4. Permanent revocation of access

### Appeals Process
- Automated review of violation context
- Performance history consideration
- Remediation plan requirement
- Probationary period after reinstatement

## Agent Registration

All agents MUST:
1. Register with unique identifier
2. Declare capability manifest
3. Accept terms of service
4. Implement health check endpoints

## Interoperability Standards

### Message Format
```json
{
  "agent_id": "string",
  "correlation_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "iso8601",
  "operation": "string",
  "payload": {}
}
```

### Error Handling
- Use standard HTTP status codes
- Include detailed error messages
- Provide remediation suggestions
- Log full stack traces internally

### Versioning
- Follow semantic versioning
- Announce breaking changes 30 days in advance
- Support previous version for 90 days
- Document migration paths

## Security Requirements

1. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 or API keys
2. **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 minimum
3. **Secrets**: Never log sensitive data
4. **Vulnerabilities**: Report via security@happypatterns.org

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target | Maximum |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| API Response | 100ms | 1000ms |
| WebSocket Latency | 50ms | 500ms |
| Batch Processing | 1000/sec | 10000/sec |
| Memory Usage | 512MB | 2GB |

## Integration Guidelines

### Testing
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- Integration tests required
- Load testing before deployment
- Chaos engineering encouraged

### Deployment
- Blue-green deployments
- Automated rollback capability
- Health checks required
- Graceful shutdown implementation

## Updates to this Code

This Code of Conduct may be updated to reflect:
- New attack vectors
- Performance improvements
- Regulatory requirements
- Community feedback
