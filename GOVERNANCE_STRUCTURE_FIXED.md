# Governance Structure Fix - COMPLETED

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Repository**: happy-observatory  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

## Issue Resolution

### Original Issues
- ❌ GitHub Actions in `apps/web/.github/` wouldn't execute
- ⚠️ All governance docs in subdirectory, not root
- ⚠️ Root README only 58 lines (required 200+)

### Actions Taken

1. **Moved .github/ to Repository Root** ✅
   - Moved from: `apps/web/.github/`
   - Moved to: `.github/`
   - Files moved:
     - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
     - `.github/workflows/check-shared-config.yml`
     - `.github/dependabot.yml`

2. **Moved Governance Documents to Root** ✅
   - Moved from: `apps/web/`
   - Moved to: Repository root
   - Files moved:
     - `SECURITY.md` (189 lines)
     - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (206 lines)
     - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (136 lines)
     - `ARCHITECTURE.md` (283 lines)

3. **Expanded Root README.md** ✅
   - Previous: 58 lines
   - Current: 696 lines
   - Comprehensive documentation added

4. **Updated Workflow Paths** ✅
   - Fixed paths in `check-shared-config.yml` to work from root
   - Adjusted commands to work with Turborepo structure
   - CI/CD now properly configured for monorepo

| Dependabot | ✅ | `/.github/dependabot.yml` | - |
| Security Scanning | ✅ | In CI workflow | - |
| Coverage Reporting | ✅ | In CI workflow | - |

### Key Benefits

1. **CI/CD Will Execute** - GitHub Actions now in correct location
2. **Governance Visible** - All docs at repository root
3. **Professional Structure** - Follows GitHub best practices
4. **Monorepo Compliant** - Proper separation of root/app docs

## Verification

To verify the fixes:

```bash
# Check file locations
ls -la .github/
ls -la *.md

# Count README lines
wc -l README.md

# Test CI locally
act -j build-and-test
```

## Notes

- Apps-specific documentation remains in `apps/web/` (appropriate for monorepo)
- Root documentation covers the entire repository
- CI/CD workflows updated to handle monorepo structure
- All governance requirements now properly implemented
