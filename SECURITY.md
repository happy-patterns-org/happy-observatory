## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email: security@happypatterns.org
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Time

- **Critical**: Within 24 hours
- **High**: Within 3 days
- **Medium**: Within 7 days
- **Low**: Within 14 days

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session timeout: 24 hours
- Refresh token rotation
- Secure token storage with httpOnly cookies

### Transport Security
- HTTPS enforced in production
- WSS for WebSocket connections
- HSTS headers enabled
- CSP policy implemented with nonces
- X-Frame-Options: DENY

### API Security
- Rate limiting: 100 req/min (anonymous), 1000 req/min (authenticated)
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection via CSP and sanitization
- CSRF protection with double-submit cookies

### Data Protection
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds minimum)
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- PII logging prevention
- Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- No sensitive data in URLs

### WebSocket Security
- Authentication required for WebSocket connections
- Message validation and sanitization
- Connection rate limiting
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

## Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

```
Content-Security-Policy: [dynamic with nonces]
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## Security Checklist

## Common Vulnerabilities Prevention

### SQL Injection
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate all inputs
- Escape special characters

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSP with nonces
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- React's built-in XSS protection

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Double-submit cookies
- SameSite cookie attribute
- Origin verification

### Authentication Bypass
- Secure session management
- Token expiration
- Proper logout implementation
- Password complexity requirements

## Incident Response

### 1. Detection
- Monitor security alerts
- Check audit logs
- Review error reports

### 2. Containment
- Isolate affected systems
- Revoke compromised tokens
- Block malicious IPs

### 3. Investigation
- Analyze logs
- Identify root cause
- Document timeline

### 4. Recovery
- Apply security patches
- Restore from backups
- Update security measures

### 5. Post-Incident
- Update documentation
- Improve monitoring
- Security training

## Security Tools

### Development
- `npm audit` - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ESLint security plugin
- OWASP dependency check

### Production
- Rate limiting (built-in)
- JWT token management
- Audit logging system
- Real-time monitoring
