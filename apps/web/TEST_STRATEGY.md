# Happy Observatory Test Strategy Charter

## Scope & Goals
- Reach **80% line & branch coverage** on `main` by end of Q1 2025
- No new code may reduce coverage (CI gate enforced)
- Focus on high-value tests that validate business logic and user flows

## Test Pyramid Ratios
- **Unit Tests**: ~70% (pure functions, utilities, hooks)
- **Integration Tests**: ~20% (API routes, WebSocket flows)
- **E2E Tests**: ~10% (critical user journeys)

## Definition of Done
A PR is "green" only when:
1. ‚úÖ ESLint/Prettier pass
2. ‚úÖ TypeScript compiles (strict mode)
3. ‚úÖ Unit tests pass
4. ‚úÖ Integration tests pass
5. ‚úÖ Coverage diff ‚â• 0%
6. ‚úÖ No high/critical security vulnerabilities

## Tooling Stack
- **Vitest** + jsdom for unit tests
- **React Testing Library** for component tests
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking
- **supertest** for HTTP route testing
- **ws** mocks for WebSocket testing
- **Playwright** for E2E tests (future)
- **c8** for coverage reports

## Quality Gates
- **Phase 1** (Current ‚Üí 30%): Focus on critical paths
- **Phase 2** (30% ‚Üí 60%): Add integration tests
- **Phase 3** (60% ‚Üí 80%): Complete coverage, add E2E
- **Maintenance**: 80% global, 70% per-file minimum

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Flaky external APIs | MSW for consistent mocking |
| Complex auth flows | Contract tests with fixed tokens |
| WebSocket timing | Fake timers + event simulation |
| Database dependencies | In-memory stores for tests |

   - ‚úÖ `password.ts` (100% covered)

2. **Core Business Logic**
   - ‚úÖ `agent-control.ts` (partial coverage - singleton complexity)
   - ‚úÖ `bridge-websocket.ts` (comprehensive tests written)
   - ‚úÖ `project-store.ts` (95.34% covered)

3. **Critical User Flows**
   - ‚úÖ `workspace-mode.tsx` (100% covered)
   - ‚úÖ `workspace-layout.tsx` (100% covered)
   - ‚úÖ `project-initializer.tsx` (100% covered)
   - ‚ùå `nexus-console.tsx` (0%)

### Tier 2: High-Risk, Low-Change
1. **Infrastructure**
   - ‚ùå `service-registry.ts` (0%)
   - ‚ùå `diagnostics.ts` (0%)
   - ‚úÖ `audit-logger.ts` (100% covered)

2. **Data Persistence**
   - ‚ùå Telemetry routes (0%)
   - ‚ùå Project management routes (0%)

### Tier 3: Low-Risk, High-Change
1. **UI Components**
   - ‚ùå Dashboard components
   - ‚ùå Status monitors
   - ‚úÖ Utility components (button, card)

### Tier 4: Low-Risk, Low-Change
1. **Static configs**
2. **Type definitions**
3. **Generated files**
