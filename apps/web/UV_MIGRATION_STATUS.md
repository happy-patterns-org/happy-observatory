# Happy Observatory - UV Migration Status

## Summary

**Status**: âœ… NO ACTION REQUIRED

Happy Observatory is a TypeScript/Next.js web application that uses npm/yarn for package management. UV is a Python package manager, so this migration does not apply to this repository.

## Current Package Management

- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- **Shared Config**: Uses `@business-org/shared-config-ts` (TypeScript package)

## What This Means

1. Happy Observatory continues using npm for all package management
2. No changes needed to build processes or CI/CD pipelines
3. The shared-config TypeScript package is consumed normally via npm
4. Development workflow remains unchanged

## Integration Points

Happy Observatory still integrates with the Python-based services through:
- WebSocket connections to Bridge Server (happy-devkit)
- REST API calls
- Shared configuration types from `@business-org/shared-config-ts`

These integration points are unaffected by the UV migration in Python repositories.

## For Reference

The UV migration applies only to Python repositories in the ecosystem:
- `happy-devkit` (Python)
- `shared-config` (Python package)
- Any other Python-based services

TypeScript/JavaScript projects like Happy Observatory continue using their native package managers.
